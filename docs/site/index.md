# LDA++

LDA++ is a C++ library and a set of accompanying console applications that
enable the inference of various [Latent Dirichlet
Allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) models.

Among the already implemented LDA variations are:

* [Unsupervised LDA](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf)
* [Supervised LDA (sLDA)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chongw/papers/WangBleiFeiFei2009.pdf)
* [Fast supervised LDA (fsLDA)](http://mug.ee.auth.gr/wp-content/uploads/fsLDA.pdf) (SHOULD CHANGE LINK WITH RESEARCH PAGE)

## Why LDA++?

**Modular architecture** allows the implementation of novel LDA variations with
minimal code.

**Clean implementations** enable a deep understanding of the variational
inference procedure followed for the available LDA models.

**Efficient multithreaded implementations** enable the inference of topics even
for large-scale datasets. Check our research page for our new method to infer
topics in a supervised manner, which is tested on UCF-101 video dataset.

## Documentation

## Example

In the following section, we provide a tiny example to point out how this
library works. In the current example we train an unsupervised LDA model on
artificially generated data.


``` cpp
#include <ldaplusplus/LDA.hpp>
#include <ldaplusplus/LDABuilder.hpp>
#include <ldaplusplus/numpy_format.hpp>


int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
    // blah
}
```

Assuming you have already installed LDA++ on your system, simply
copy and paste the following instructions in a terminal to compile the previous
example.

~~~
$ wget http://ldaplusplus.com/files/mnist.tar.gz
$ tar -zxf mnist.tar.gz
$ g++ example.cpp -lldaplusplus -o example
$ ./example minst_train.npy mnist_test.npy
